# Week 2 Project - Your first javscript code

This homework assignment is designed to see your ability to write basic javascript code from scratch.

### Instructions

Create a javascript file named like so: `{first name or discord name}-project1.js` So mine might be called `chris-project1.js` or `ink-project1.js`.

This file must complete these requirements.

1. It declares variables of type `string`, `number`, `null` and `undefined`.
2. It must check `if` your `string` declared variable is a `typeof` `string` and output `hello, string` to console when ran.


Turn this assignment in via email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) discord or facebook.

Best of luck, ask me if you get stuck.
