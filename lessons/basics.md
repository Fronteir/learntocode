### Why Javascript?

This is a good question because javascript is admittedly not the ideal first language to learn. It is very loosely typed with lot of 'gotcha' knowledge that only come with experience of using the language.

That said, few reasons why I chose this

- It is currently the most popular language due to the fact is it what all browsers natively run. This is extremely powerful as every operating system (MacOSX, Windows, Linux, shit probably even TempleOS) runs browsers. This cross-compatibility has made javascript not only the language of choice for browsers, but industry-level servers as well (NodeJs), as well as slew of resources based on it.
- Based on above fact, it is very easy to run on computers, making the setup much easier for you and me.
- I, as a programmer, am strongest in javascript. Though I've developed professionally in Java (yes, Java does NOT equal javascript) and Ruby, my main professional language has been js for the past half decade plus.

### Lesson One: Variables

Javascript variables are very freeform. They can be a lot of things, and interactions between different `types` can be very... unique. We'll go over the basics and go a little deeper.
